// there is copy incase of numbers, strings,booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    const team=players;
    console.table(players,team);
    team[3]='Lux';
    console.table(players,team);
// there is refrencing in case of arrays and objects

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2=players.slice();
    // one way
    const team3=[].concat(players);
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team4=[...players] // but it may spread inner/nested objects/arrays
    // or use the new ES6 Spread


    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2=Object.assign({},person,{number:99,age:32});
    console.log(cap2)
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3={...person}
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    // Object.assign is also shallow
    // one way to deepcopy
    const dev2=JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person));
